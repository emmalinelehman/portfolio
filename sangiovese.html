<h2>Tasting Sangiovese Wine</h2>
<p>Sangiovese is typically quite savory. However, Sangiovese offers a truly wide range of tastes that can range from rounded and fruit-forward to very rustic and earthy. When trying a new Sangiovese, dedicate a moment to sit and smell it for a while. As you sit and sniff, you may begin to notice that the aromas move towards dried roses, cherries, and figs. This is especially true with older Sangiovese wines.</p>

<h2>Pairing Sangiovese</h2>
<p>Because of the medium weighted body and savory characteristics, Sangiovese tends to pair well with a large variety of foods!</p>
<p>A Sangiovese with high tannic content will pair beautifully with rich meats, cured sausages, and hard sharp cheeses. For a vegetarian option, herbs and tomatoes will bring out the fruity elements. However, it is important that these be paired with various fats such as butter or olive oil. Lipids help cut through the natural tannins in Sangiovese and all other tannic wines and produce a beautiful pairing.</p>
